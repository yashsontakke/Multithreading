//    When notify() is called, a waiting thread moves from "Waiting" to "Runnable".
//    However, it does not directly get the lock.
//    The thread is now competing with other threads for the CPU and lock.
//    The JVM thread scheduler decides which thread actually gets the lock and runs.

    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}

//‚ùå Misconception: Threads Need Another notify() to Get the Lock
//üö´ Wrong: "All threads need to be notified again before they can run."
//‚úÖ Correct: "Threads are already in RUNNABLE after notifyAll(), they just need to wait for the lock."


//‚ùì Does notifyAll() Make All Threads RUNNING?
//‚ùå No!
//‚úÖ It only moves them to RUNNABLE.
//‚úÖ They still need to compete for the lock before they can run.

//        1Ô∏è‚É£ notifyAll() Wakes Up Only WAITING Threads
//
//        All threads that are currently in WAITING move to RUNNABLE.
//        Threads that are already in RUNNABLE remain unchanged (they do not get notified again).
//        Only one thread at a time gets the lock and enters RUNNING.
//        2Ô∏è‚É£ Competition for Lock (RUNNABLE Threads Compete)
//
//        All RUNNABLE threads now compete for the lock.
//        The thread that wins gets the lock and enters RUNNING state.
//        The rest stay in RUNNABLE, waiting for the lock.
//        3Ô∏è‚É£ When the Lock is Released, Another RUNNABLE Thread Gets It
//
//        The currently running thread finishes its work and releases the lock.
//        One of the remaining RUNNABLE threads gets the lock next.
//        No new notification (notifyAll()) is needed for RUNNABLE threads‚Äîthey are just waiting for the lock.
//        4Ô∏è‚É£ WAITING Threads Do Not Move Until Another notifyAll() is Called
//
//        If any thread enters WAITING after notifyAll() was already called, it will NOT be notified again until the next notifyAll().
